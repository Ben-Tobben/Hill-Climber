"# Hill-Climber" 
To run this code on the number of options you want, change the DIMENSIONS value to the number of options you want to run. Then, if you want to change the options run from the default first n options, add the options you want to columns in main. The options are 0 indexed, so if you want the first option, put 0, the second, put 1 ect. You must then also  comment out the line that makes the default columns. There are comments in the code about where to do these things, and the image below shows them as well.
